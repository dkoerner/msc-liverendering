## Interactive remote path-tracing using a High Performance Computing Cluster

![thumbnail](https://raw.github.com/dkoerner/msc-liverendering/master/thumbnail.png)

This application was developed as part of the [Media Solution Center BW project](https://msc-bw.com/). It demonstrates interactive path-traced 3D scene lighting using cloud computing in the browser. A browser frontend on a local machine is connected to a remote high performance computing cluster ([CRAY XC40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_XC40)) at the [High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart](https://www.hlrs.de/home/). The rendering backend is using the [OSPRay](https://www.ospray.org/) renderer from Intel. The frontend is a custom build javascript application derived from [threejs editor](https://threejs.org/editor/).
